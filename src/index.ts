// aipooljs — fixed-size object pool for hot-path acquire/release patterns.
//
// v0.1.0: full implementation of the frozen API surface. Stack-backed
// available set, Set-tracked alive objects, double-release detection,
// idempotent dispose, destructurable methods (no `this`).
//
// v0.3.0: additive additions —
//   • onOverflow: 'throw' | 'null' | 'grow' | fn   (OverflowHandler<T>)
//   • borrow(fn, opts?)  — try/finally acquire/release + AbortSignal

/**
 * Overflow strategy passed to {@link PoolOptions.onOverflow}.
 *
 * - `'throw'` (default) — throws {@link PoolError} when the pool is empty.
 * - `'null'` — {@link Pool.acquire} returns `null` instead of throwing; the pool
 *   state is not mutated.
 * - `'grow'` — doubles capacity by allocating `currentCapacity` new objects via
 *   `create()` (O(capacity) re-alloc + same-frame GC spike). Use only where
 *   unbounded growth is acceptable.
 * - function handler — called with the pool as argument; return value is added to
 *   the alive set and handed to the caller. **Warning:** if the handler recycles
 *   an already-alive object (e.g. "evict the oldest"), the previous holder's
 *   reference is aliased — any subsequent `release` from either party may throw
 *   `PoolError("foreign or double-released")`. This is an escape hatch; caller
 *   takes full responsibility.

   * **Invariants:**
   * 1. `release(obj)` is guaranteed to run in `finally` — on sync throw,
   *    async reject, or abort.
   * 2. If `opts.signal` is aborted before or during `fn`, `borrow` releases
   *    the slot immediately and rejects with `signal.reason` (default:
   *    `AbortError` DOMException). If the signal is already aborted before
   *    `borrow` is called, the promise rejects without acquiring or calling
   *    `fn`.
   * 3. Abort does **not** cancel inner work — `fn` keeps running; `signal` is
   *    advisory. See **INV6** below.
   * 4. If the pool is disposed, `borrow` throws `PoolDisposedError`
   *    synchronously, before `acquire` or `fn`.
   * 5. If `onOverflow` is `'null'` and the pool is full, `borrow` throws
   *    `PoolError` synchronously; `fn` is never called.
   * 6. **Abort does not fence inner work.** When `signal` aborts, `borrow`
   *    releases the slot and rejects immediately. It does **not** cancel the
   *    work inside `fn` — the signal is advisory. If `fn` keeps touching the
   *    borrowed object after abort, it may mutate an object another caller has
   *    since acquired. `fn` must observe `signal.aborted` and stop touching
   *    the object the moment it aborts. Treat the borrowed object as invalid
   *    once `signal` fires.
   *
   * **Sync vs async dispatch:** disposed/overflow errors are thrown
   * synchronously (both overloads). A pre-aborted signal yields a rejected
   * Promise. The async branch activates only when `fn` returns a native
   * `Promise`; a non-`instanceof Promise` thenable is treated as sync —
   * release runs immediately and the thenable is returned as-is (document
   * this at call site if needed). Callers using `.catch()` instead of
   * `await` must also wrap the call in `try/catch` to handle the
   * synchronous error cases.
